# Nile: Rejection Email Classifier

## Overview
Nile is an open-source project aimed at developing an AI model and Chrome plugin to help individuals detect rejection emails from job applications and other sources. The project collects rejection emails from contributors and uses them to train a machine learning model that can accurately classify incoming emails as rejection or non-rejection.

## Purpose
The purpose of Nile is to provide individuals with a tool to automate the process of identifying rejection emails, allowing them to manage their job search more efficiently. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the classifier aims to accurately distinguish rejection emails from other types of correspondence, saving users time and effort.

## How to Contribute
To contribute to the Nile project, follow these steps:

1. **Collect Rejection Emails**: If you receive a rejection email from a job application or any other source, forward it to collscodes@gmail.com or copy it to the [Google Docs document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NQUkfRAh4luR2vPb5bLsVSDEiolZNqp6MbSYBxhpia4/edit?usp=sharing).
2. **Join the Data Collection Phase**: Participate in the one-month data collection phase by contributing rejection emails.
3. **Collaborate on Model Creation**: Once the data collection phase is complete, collaborate with other contributors on the two-week model creation phase to develop and train the AI model.
4. **Contribute to Chrome Plugin Development**: Contribute to the development of the Chrome plugin, which will integrate the email classifier into users' email clients for seamless detection of rejection emails.
5. **Submit Pull Requests**: Submit pull requests to the project repository with improvements, bug fixes, or new features.
6. **Provide Feedback**: Share feedback and suggestions for improving the Nile project's functionality and usability.

## How to Obtain the Dataset

To build a robust dataset for training the rejection email classifier, consider the following methods:

1. **Crowdsourcing**: You can crowdsource the collection of rejection and non-rejection emails by asking volunteers to contribute emails they have received. This approach can help gather a diverse range of emails from different sources and industries.

2. **Public Datasets**: Look for publicly available datasets that contain email data. While these datasets may not be specifically labeled for rejection or non-rejection, you can manually label the emails or use automated techniques to classify them.

3. **Scraper Tools**: Use web scraping tools to extract emails from online sources, such as job boards or company websites. Be mindful of privacy and data protection laws when collecting emails in this way.

4. **Custom Email Collection**: Collect emails from your own network or contacts, ensuring you have permission to use the data for training purposes. This approach can provide a more controlled and targeted dataset.

5. **Data Augmentation**: If you have a limited dataset, you can use data augmentation techniques to artificially increase the size of your dataset. This can involve adding noise to existing emails or generating synthetic emails based on existing samples.
